# Code & Assets Library

A curated GitHub repository of reusable code snippets, scripts, and assets. Designed for quick access, easy integration, and faster project development.

## Features

If you want, I can **make an even fancier “GitHub-profile-ready” version** with:  
- Colored badges  
- Animated GIFs/screenshots  
- Table of contents for easy navigation  

This will make your repo **stand out among thousands of others**.  

Do you want me to do that?
